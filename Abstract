This document contains details about our problem statement.

1) Soda Machine Problem
We see many soda shops in our localities and even though the soda pops out of a machine, pretty much everything is done by the vendor and it increases the time of service and also increases the chances of spillage, underfill, overfill, etc..
To counter this issue we propose an automated soda machine which works (literally) by the tips our hand. We need to show some gestures corresponding to different button on soda m/c and the preinstalled cups fixed in their places will be filled by the flavour of our choice.
Okay, so now this works when we show different number gestures to the camera installed on top of soda m/c. Each number (1-4) corresponds to different flavours of soda and the number 5 is reserved for shutting down the machine.

Code Logic :
We saved our numbers model and loaded it in the code. Then we predicted the class of the image shown by user (tested this) with our model and saved the o/p to variable called classes.
We then assigned a bool to check for the state of the machine where 'True' means on and 'False means off. It is followed by if statements where we check the I/P class given to us and accordingly we operate the buttons on soda m/c and print a small line of text for user to comprehend.
When we get an input of number five our bool is set to false which implies that the m/c is now turned off.
