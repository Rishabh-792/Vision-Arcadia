# Vision-Arcadia Project
This is a project created by team RoboKnight

We used sequential CNN to build a model to recognize hand gestures like :

• Numbers
  ‣ One
  ‣ Two
  ‣ Three
  ‣ Four
  ‣ Five
  
• Symbols
  ‣ Fist ✊
  ‣ Ok 👌
  ‣ Swag 🤘
  ‣ Thumbs Down 👎
  ‣ Thumbs Up 👍
  ‣ Yo 🤟

We then deployed the trained model on RPi to automate laptop keys and two machine projects :
  1) Alarm Clock
  2) Soda Machine
